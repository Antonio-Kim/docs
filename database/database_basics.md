The example used here is through Windows 11. Go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ and download the installer. Continue clicking on next and once you arrive to component screen, select all of pgAdmin Tool, Stack Builder, and Command Line Tools. PostgreSQL should be selected by default. Next, enter in password, and leave the port number to be 5432, which is the default port for PostgreSQL. Get to end and install all the components. In the Stack Builder, click on PostGIS component, and if applicable, click on Python Extention. At the time of writing, this was not available.
